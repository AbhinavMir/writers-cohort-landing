 A 4-week cohort that runs 10x a year. The rules are simple: you write
        what you want to. Everything else is negotiable. The group will be 4-10
        folks, and the aim is to learn how to put words to your ideas and
        feelings. The cohort is free of charge, run by volunteers (currently
